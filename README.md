# Case Converter
---
## About
We work with texts quite often, and it's very sad when it turns out that the text should have been written in a different case. Instead of editing it, you can use this application

## How it works
This application is able to convert a text into the `upper case`, `lower case`, `proper case`, and `sentence case`.

The upper case is the case when each letter is in the upper case. <br/> For example:
`THIS IS THE UPPER CASE TEXT`.
    
The lower case is the case when each letter is in the lower case. <br/>
For example: `this is the lower case text`.

The proper case is the case when each word starts with the upper case, and the rest of the word is in the lower. <br/> 
For example: `This Is The Proper Case Text`.

The sentence case is the case when each sentence starts with an upper case letter, and the rest of the sentence is in the lower case. <br/> 
For example: `This is the sentence case. Only the first word of the sentence starts with an upper case letter`.
